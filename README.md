# Control Systems Design (2019-2020)

This repository contains the **Matlab-SIMULINK implementation** for the exercise of the **Control Systems Design** lecture series held by NTUA during the 6th semester (Spring 2020) of the ECE undergraduate course. The exercise involves simulating the balance control of an inverted pendulum with given initial conditions.
